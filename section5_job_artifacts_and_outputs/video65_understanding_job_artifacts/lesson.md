If we have a job and with that job, we generate some assets that must be uploaded somewhere or distributed somewhere.
These are the output asset(s), eg app binary, website files, etc.
That's what a Job Artifacts is: It's the output, the assets generated by a Job.

For example, we could have a Job that automatically picks up those produced files, and uploads them to some web hosting provider.

we're talking about files here,files and folders produced by a Job, that we want to use in other Jobs, or manually inspect after the Job finished.
